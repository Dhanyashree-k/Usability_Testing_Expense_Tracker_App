# Usability_Testing_Expense_Tracker_App

---

## 🧠 Objective
To evaluate the usability of my **Expense Tracker App prototype** by testing it with real users, collecting feedback on navigation, clarity, and visual appeal, and improving the design based on findings.

## 🧩 Testing Method
I used **Option A (Remote Testing)** by sharing my prototype link with **three participants**.  
Users were asked to perform basic actions such as:
- Adding an expense  
- Viewing analytics  
- Navigating between screens  

Feedback was collected using a **Google Form**.

---

## 📝 Sample Questions
1. Was the navigation easy to understand?  
2. Which screen was most confusing or unclear?  
3. How would you rate the overall look and feel (1–5)?  
4. Was the text size and color easy to read?  
5. Which part of the app did you like the most?  
6. Do you think the animations and transitions were smooth?  
7. Any suggestions to improve the design?

## ✏️ Summary
> I conducted usability testing on my Expense Tracker prototype with three users via Google Forms.  
> The overall response was positive — users liked the design and animations.  
> Feedback revealed that the Home and Login screens could be clearer, so I refined layout spacing, improved navigation labels, and added smoother transitions.  
> The final prototype offers a cleaner and more intuitive experience.

---

## 💡 Learning Outcome
> This task helped me understand the importance of **usability testing** in validating design decisions.  
> Small user insights — like spacing, flow, or animation — can make big improvements in usability.  
> Iterating based on user feedback strengthened my understanding of **user-centered design** and **prototype refinement**.
